I have written a basic code in c sharp language how to communicate the scanner with the PC. Now I am working on how to develop the code where i can put my finger in the scanner and it displays my pulse rate and oxygen level.
Please help me find out how.
I have also attached the screenshots of the output which is giving only hexa decimal value in the output.
Thanks
